You can now see various categories such as \"Computer Parts, PC Components,\" \"GPU's / Video Graphics Cards,\" \"Components & Storage,\" and \"Today's Best Deals.\" This action is relevant to your request because the shopping cart is typically located within the app's navigation menu or the \"My Cart\" section, which is not visible in the current screenshot but can often be found in the app's main menu. To find the shopping cart, you may need to swipe up or tap on the menu icon (usually three horizontal lines) located at the top-left corner of the app screen."
