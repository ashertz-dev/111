    "action_result": "The action of clicking on the \"Spotify Lite\" search suggestion has brought you to the installation page of the Spotify Lite app. This is a step towards completing the user request, as uninstalling \"Spotify\" involves removing the app completely from the device. However, uninstallation requires access to the app itself, which is not visible on the current screen. Therefore, this action has made progress towards the user request but it requires further steps to achieve the final goal."
