This change allows for a more natural and convenient way to interact with the search engine, potentially improving the user experience. However, since the user's request is to know the news in Vietnam, and the microphone feature does not provide any information related to the query, it does not directly progress towards completing the user request. The next step would be to use the microphone to dictate the user's query and then search for the news in Vietnam.",
